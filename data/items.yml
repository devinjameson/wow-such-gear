  - item-name: "Minimoog Model D Reissue"
    item-description: "An all time classic. Tons of modern synths take cues from the design language of the Model D.
    Has a very sweet and warm sound. It's also just really beautiful."

  - item-name: "Korg Minilogue"
    item-description: "4-voice analog polysynth. Very popular due to its relatively low price in the analog
    polysynth realm, its versatility, and its unique sound. Simultaneously fun and professional sounding."


  - item-name: "Korg Monologue"
    item-description: "The Minilogue's younger sibling. Monophone with a more driven sound.The built-in drive
    circuit can help generate more compressed, harmonically-rich tones. Kind of an odd duck 
    but occasionally very useful."


  - item-name: "Studiologic Sledge"
    item-description: "Digital polysynth. Think Blade Runner. It's got that digital resonance thing
    going on that makes everything sound like '80s sci-fi. Really fun!"


  - item-name: "Elektron Digitone"
    item-description: "An unassuming beast. One of the most impressive feats of UI/UX I've seen in an
    instrument. Enables some really interesting and powerful options for modulation and performance.
    The step automation capability, in particular, delivers a sound I can't find elsewhere."


  - item-name: "Soma Synths Lyra 8"
    item-description: "Weird. Unpredictable. Many, many, many knobs. What exactly they do? Not sure.
    Does it matter? No. Sounds neat. Makes noises. Good."

- category: "Outboard Hardware"
  items:
  - item-name: "Universal Audio 6176"
    item-description: "Classic preamp. Super smooth and warm, almost saccharine. Makes everything
    sound vintage. Has the ability to compress heavily, but still sound natural. Has a purple light."

  - item-name: "API The Channel Strip"
    item-description: "Have two because stereo. So unbelievably awesome. Makes anything you run through
    it sound Professionalâ„¢. Sometimes I'll run a drum buss through it and it just comes out sounding
    mixed."

  - item-name: "Roland Space Echo"
    item-description: "Needs no introduction. Sci-fi spacey tape delay. The best part is opening up
    the top and watching the tape move. Also changing the repeat rate on the fly for slow-down effects!"

- category: "Pedals"
  items:
  - item-name: "Chase Bliss Tonal Recall RKM"
    item-description: "A very guitar-y delay. Firm and tight BBD sound. I'll only use it on synths if
    I want something syncopated. Really special pedal for guitar."


  - item-name: "Chase Bliss Warped Vinyl mkII"
    item-description: "Gooey and warm, with some nice fuzzy noise on top if the high-pass is disengaged.
    Can make things sound just a tad different if that's what the part needs. Best on guitar, but
    also works great on synths."


  - item-name: "Chase Bliss M O O D"
    item-description: "Bleep and bloop machine! Put a thing in and get a cooler thing out. Haven't had a
    ton of time to get into it, but it's really fun and has a sound I haven't heard elsewhere."

  - item-name: "Chase Bliss Dark World"
    item-description: "Unique digital reverb with two sides named 'dark' and 'world'. Each side can be routed
    into the other or they can be played in parallel. Dark has weird, modulated, shimmery, noisy stuff 
    going on. World has a plate, spring, and hall verb. A rather cold sound."

  - item-name: "Chase Bliss Condor"
    item-description: "Analog pre/eq. This is an 'always-on' front-end pedal for me for guitar. Gives things
    a nice round tone going through the rest of the chain. Can be a bit much for synths, but occasionally really nice."

  - item-name: "Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Memory Man"
    item-description: "Another BBD delay with a very different sound. So good on flowy synth and guitar 
    stuff. Combines the dry and wet signal beautifully. The repeats also roll off really smoothly. Seems like
    each repeat get a bit more saturated and loses some high-end."

  - item-name: "Demedash T-120 Videotape Echo"
    item-description: "Another delay, but a special one. Wait list is really long of this friend. Has a character
    that's hard to explain. If I had to describe it I would say it sounds like the '90s."

  - item-name: "JHS Colour Box"
    item-description: "Lundahl transformer. Supposed to sound like plugging directly into a Neve console. 
    Haven't used it much, but most likely will for low-gain stuff. Adds a little something special."

  - item-name: "Elektron Analog Drive"
    item-description: "Versatile drive pedal. I use it primarily for guitar on low gain. Really love the sound of
    this. Got it on sale for like $80 and it sounds amazing for that price."

- category: "Guitars"
  items:
  - item-name: "Fender Stratocaster"
    item-description: "Just your basic strat. Got it when I was like 15. Not much else to say. Sounds great!"

  - item-name: "Fender Mark Hoppus Signature Bass"
    item-description: "Got this because of the pickups it came with, but I also like the simplicity. Has
    a nice chunky sound. I use flat-wound strings."

  - item-name: "Epiphone Les Paul"
    item-description: "Acquired this a few years ago, but honestly haven't really found a way to get it to
    sound how I want. It's got a very driven 'rock' type sound which doesn't feel natural for me. Maybe
    I'll figure it out, who knows."

  - item-name: "Vintage Epiphone Acoustic"
    item-description: "Picked this up on the cheap because I wanted a J45, but didn't want to spend
    thousands of dollars. Sounds really nice."

- category: "Drum Machines"
  items:
  - item-name: "Alesis HR-16"
    item-description: "Lol. Ridiculously hard to program. But has that retro, digital drum machine sound
    that you can't really capture in software. Must be the subpar D/A conversion."

  - item-name: "Volca Beats"
    item-description: "Suprisingly fun and nice sounding for its size. The stutter effect is my favorite part.
    If you use it on the 'global' setting and play with the time knob you get can some really cool choppy stuff."

- category: "Miscellaneous"
  items:
  - item-name: "Yamaha MSP7s"
    item-description: "Bought these monitors when I was like 15. They were the floor models at Sam Ash,
    so were a little beat up, but still sounded fantastic. They have a very open and wide sound. I don't
    have a treated room, so can't use them much for mixing, but they're still great."

  - item-name: "Sennheiser HD650s"
    item-description: "Studio monitors on mixing duty. Open back. great sound stage. I use them with
    Sonarworks software to get them properly calibrated, which makes a huge difference."

  - item-name: "Ableton Push 2"
    item-description: "Really cool MIDI controller. Best part is that it can be used with Bitwig and
    even Reaper. I don't use Ableton much anymore, but the pads on this thing are really nice."

  - item-name: "Apogee Quartet"
    item-description: "Main I/O. Really clean preamps. I wanted to get something that would last a long time,
    but not break the bank, and this fit the bill."

  - item-name: "Universal Audio Arrow"
    item-description: "I use this purely for recording plugins out of my laptop and through hardware. It forces
    me to treat virtual instruments like hardware, which I prefer for workflow reasons."

  - item-name: "Schiit Magni 2"
    item-description: "Headphone amp. Not too expensive and doesn't color the sound too much. Drives
    the Sennheiser HD650s just fine."

  - item-name: "Bitwig"
    item-description: "Digital audio workstation. I used to use Ableton, but it has a lot of performance issues
    when projects get really big. Bitwig is great for huge projects because it handles CPU usage in a really
    smart way. If tracks aren't playing anything or are muted, the CPU usage goes to zero. Also has a UI that's
    very similar to Ableton so wasn't hard to switch over."

- category: "Plugin Bundles"
  items:
  - item-name: "Slate Digital All Access Pass"
    item-description: "I probably use Virtual Mix Rack on every individual track in any given project. Mostly
    FG-73, FG-116, and FG-N. I especially love the FG-116 compressor. It levels things out so smoothly.
    The All Access Pass includes a ton more though. Reverbs, instruments, buss compressors, etc. It's honestly
    an incredible value, highly recommend."

  - item-name: "Softube Volume 3"
    item-description: "Lots of cool stuff in this bundle. I don't use any of it super frequently, but it's
    really useful when you need it."

  - item-name: "Kush Plugins"
    item-description: "Novatron, UBK-1, and Omega N in particular each have a sound I haven't heard anywhere
    else."

  - item-name: "Arturia 3 Compressors"
    item-description: "I use the tube compressor on a ton of stuff. Levels things out really nicely. Mostly
    use it on synth parts with lots of reverb."

  - item-name: "Arturia 3 Preamps"
    item-description: "They just sound really nice. When I need a little extra something on a track, but
    you're not sure what, this can be a nice subtle boost."

  - item-name: "Arturia 3 Delays"
    item-description: "The BBD delay in particular really nails the sound."

  - item-name: "Arturia V Collection"
    item-description: "Great vintage synth emulations. The CS-80 is really good. Also love the Matrix-12 emulation."

  - item-name: "Native Instruments Komplete"
    item-description: "So much in this bundle. Lots of useful stuff. Monark, Massive, Kontakt, etc."

- category: "Reverb Plugins"
  items:
  - item-name: "d16 Toraverb"
    item-description: "Expansive, modulated, and at times unwieldy. Love it."

  - item-name: "Valhalla Shimmer"
    item-description: "If you imagine what 'shimmer' might sound like, it does that. Usually use it on
    synths if I want them to sound more bright and airy."

  - item-name: "Valhalla Vintageverb"
    item-description: "Full, round, deep, modulated reverb. Sounds great on everything."

- category: "Delay Plugins"
  items:
  - item-name: "d16 Repeater"
    item-description: "Reliable delay. It's the first one I reach for when I think 'needs delay'."

  - item-name: "Valhalla Delay"
    item-description: "Has an interesting way of making everything sound bigger and more expansive.
    Probably because of the diffusion control. Everything Valhalla puts out is gold."

  - item-name: "u-he Colour Copy"
    item-description: "Really good for modulated delay. Also has a cool feedback colouration cirtcuit
    for saturating the repeats in different ways."

  - item-name: "Soundtoys Echoboy"
    item-description: "Indispensable delay. Sounds really smooth and blends with the source quite nicely.
    The memory man emulation is excellent."

- category: "Synth Plugins"
  items:
  - item-name: "d16 Lush-101"
    item-description: "Sounds like an analog polysynth but with 1,000,000 modulation options and controls and layers
    and all of those things."
